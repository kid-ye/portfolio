I've been coding and building apps since I was 12. I first started with C# and Unity, building small games on [Itch](https://singharsh.itch.io).

My first laptop had an i3 chip with 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD. I used to only be able to run a dev server and a single chrome tab, and would connect headphones to my phone to listen to music.

## How it started

I spent my early teens messing around with Linux, open-source, databases, hardware, and participating in numerous hackathons.

Things really took a turn for me when I launched [kmenu](https://kmenu.dev) when I was 15, which led to me getting my first contract offer(s). Coding went from being something I did for fun to a serious, full time job.

At this point, my age became my greatest enemy. Before I was 18, I'd lied about my age so many times to so many different people that I don't even remember how old some people think I am now.

After turning 18, I went to Purdue for 2 semesters, where I continued working full-time on contracts. These few months were perhaps the most grueling of my life, between university and work, which is why I decided to drop out and continue working as a software engineer.

## Now

I now have 4+ years of experience growing engineering at small scale startups. I'm currently leading a team of 10 engineers at a seed-round startup. On the side, I'm building AI automation software for the public sector.

I'm in the evergreen process of learning and building, and I love every second of it. The world is an endless medium of opportunities and I have yet to scratch the surface.
